## About

### Summary

Devops engineer with a bachelor's degree in CS and near the five years of
experience in some technologies and programming languages.
I mainly act in a devops field: from automation of routine processes using
scripting languages like Python and Bash to develop and maintain reliable
systems for big data processing in cloud platforms (in particular AWS).
I also have a great interest in systems programming: especially the development
in Rust.

I dealt with bare-metal servers rather than the now familiar cloud solutions.
To automate routine processes I was creating Ansible playbooks for upgrade and
deployment Confluence instances to the stage and production environments.

Also was deploying and troubleshooting Bitbucket’s mirror farm.  Our team has
created CI/CD pipelines using Buildbot (not very popular solution).

I’ve also developed CLI utility using Python for automatic migration from one
CRM system to another (Salesforce to JIRA) in a fairly short period of time.

And of course my daily duties included monitoring the state of the servers,
administering and configuring Linux hosts (authentication, logging, cleanup,
provisioning new VMs and containers, networking problems etc), administering
Atlassian stack (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket).

Started as a support engineer in a big data field.  Our team was responsible
for keeping the distributed data processing clusters up and running (Hadoop,
Hive, Impala, Spark, HBase, Zookeper, Apache Kafka). Also this position
provided me an opportunity to learn Linux internals more deeply (Linux PAM,
cgroups, systemd, LVM etc).  As a operation team member I was also involved
into communication with the customers.

After promotion to the Devops engineer role I was developing CI/CD pipelines
for customers' applications which exploited big data platform using Jenkins,
Ansible, Python, Gitlab and Bash.

Modeled, developed and maintained AWS CloudFormation templates for managing and
provisioning infrastructure as a code.

Refactored and evolved existing Ansible playbooks for full infrastructure
configuration.

Configured Kerberos security protocol for authentication of services within
Hadoop cluster.

Automated standard operations and procedures to reduce manual work and time for
routines (using Jenkins scripted pipelines and Python / Bash scripts)

Provided backup and disaster recovery strategies for infrastructure (with AWS
capabilities: EBS snapshots, RDS multi A-Z, S3 cross-region replication etc).

Containerized custom application for big data processing using Docker. There
was a request for storing all components in a single container, that's
absolutely contradicts Docker's paradigm. Nevertheless build process included
configuration of the application itself and provisioning and configuration
database (Postgresql). The total weight of the container was quite large (~4.29
GB) and our team planned to split the application into separate services but
unfortunately I didn't see the final result as I finished working for the
company by that time.
