## About

### Summary

Devops engineer with a bachelor\'s degree in CS and near the seven years of
experience in some technologies and programming languages.
I mainly act in a devops field: from automation of routine processes using
scripting languages like Python and Bash to develop and maintain reliable
systems for big data processing in cloud platforms (in particular AWS).
I also have a great interest in systems programming: especially the development
in Rust.

Prototyped and implemented CI infrastructure using terraform as IaC
solution. The infrastructure consisted of Kubernetes cluster deployed on
AWS Fargate with Jenkins application as a CI system, AWS PCA for TLS
encryption, cert-manager for the certificates rotation and dockerhub as
a container registry.

Configured in-cluster container registry to incrementally download big
images using Harbor and SOCI index.

Prototyped and implemented CI system using Jenkins, Docker Swarm, and
HAProxy.  Deployed monitoring solution with Prometheus, Grafana and
Grafana Mimir.  Configured alerting with Prometheus AlertManager and
Slack.  Implemented SSO authentication using SAML2.0 and GSuite as
identity provider.

Deployed self-hosted runners for bitbucket pipelines

Created and refactored bunch of groovy pipelines for developer and
tester teams.

Maintained production and development infrastructures.

Developed Ansible playbooks for upgrade and deployment Confluence
instances to the stage and production environments.

Deployed and troubleshooted Bitbucket mirror farm.

Maintained configuration for the Buildbot CI tool.

Developed CLI utility using Python for automatic migration from one CRM
system to another (Salesforce to JIRA) in a fairly short period of time.

And of course my daily duties included monitoring the state of the servers,
administering and configuring Linux hosts (authentication, logging, cleanup,
provisioning new VMs and containers, networking problems &c), administering
Atlassian stack (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket).

Started as a L2 support engineer in a big data field. Our team was
responsible for keeping the distributed data processing clusters up and
running (Hadoop, Hive, Impala, Spark, HBase, Zookeper, Apache Kafka).
Also this position provided me an opportunity to learn Linux internals
more deeply (Linux PAM, cgroups, systemd, LVM &c). As a operation team
member i was also involved into communication with the customers.

After promotion to the Devops engineer role i was developing CI/CD pipelines
for customers\' applications which exploited big data platform using Jenkins,
Ansible, Python, Gitlab and Bash.

Modeled, developed and maintained AWS CloudFormation templates for managing and
provisioning infrastructure as a code.

Refactored and evolved existing Ansible playbooks for full infrastructure
configuration.

Configured Kerberos security protocol for authentication of services within
Hadoop cluster.

Automated standard operations and procedures to reduce manual work and time for
routines (using Jenkins scripted pipelines and Python / Bash scripts)

Provided backup and disaster recovery strategies for infrastructure (with AWS
capabilities: EBS snapshots, RDS multi A-Z, S3 cross-region replication &c).

Containerized custom application for big data processing using Docker.
