## About

### Summary

Devops engineer with a bachelor's degree in CS and near the seven years of
experience in some technologies and programming languages. I mainly act in a
devops field: from automation of routine processes using scripting languages
like Python and Bash to develop and maintain reliable systems for big data
processing in cloud platforms (in particular AWS). I also have a great interest
in systems programming: especially the development in Rust.

## Work Experience

| **[Morse Micro](https://morsemicro.com) (full-time)** | **Dec 2022 - Present (2 years, 1 month)** |
| :- | -: |
| Devops engineer | Sydney NSW, Australia |

- Prototyped and implemented CI infrastructure using terraform as IaC solution.
  The infrastructure consisted of Kubernetes cluster deployed on AWS Fargate
  with Jenkins application as a CI system, AWS PCA for TLS encryption,
  cert-manager for the certificates rotation and dockerhub as a container
  registry.
- Configured in-cluster container registry to incrementally download big images
  using Harbor and SOCI index.
- Prototyped and implemented CI system using Jenkins, Docker Swarm, and
  HAProxy. Deployed monitoring solution with Prometheus, Grafana and Grafana
  Mimir. Configured alerting with Prometheus AlertManager and Slack. Implemented
  SSO authentication using SAML2.0 and GSuite as identity provider.
- Deployed self-hosted runners for bitbucket pipelines.
- Created and refactored bunch of groovy pipelines for developer and tester
  teams.
- Maintained production and development infrastructures.

| **[onsemi](https://onsemi.com) (full-time)** | **Nov 2021 - Oct 2022 (1 year)** |
| :- | -: |
| Devops engineer | St Petersburg City, Russia |

- Developed Ansible playbooks for upgrade and deployment Confluence instances to
  the stage and production environments.
- Deployed and troubleshooted Bitbucket mirror farm.
- Maintained configuration for the Buildbot CI tool.
- Developed CLI utility using Python for automatic migration from one CRM system
  to another (Salesforce to JIRA) in a fairly short period of time.
- Monitored the state of servers and administered Linux hosts (authentication,
  logging, cleanup, provisioning new VMs and containers, networking problems
  &c).
- Administered Atlassian stack (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket).

| **[EPAM Systems](https://epam.com) (full-time)** | **Jul 2018 - Nov 2021 (3 years, 5 months)** |
| :- | -: |
| Systems engineer | St Petersburg City, Russia |

- Started as a L2 support engineer in a big data field. Our team was responsible
  for keeping the distributed data processing clusters up and running (Hadoop,
  Hive, Impala, Spark, HBase, Zookeper, Apache Kafka).
- Learned Linux internals more deeply (Linux PAM, cgroups, systemd, LVM &c) and
  communicated with customers as an operations team member.
- Developed CI/CD pipelines for customers' applications which exploited big data
  platform using Jenkins, Ansible, Python, Gitlab and Bash.
- Modeled, developed and maintained AWS CloudFormation templates for managing
  and provisioning infrastructure as a code.
- Refactored and evolved existing Ansible playbooks for full infrastructure
  configuration.
- Configured Kerberos security protocol for authentication of services within
  Hadoop cluster.
- Automated standard operations and procedures to reduce manual work and time for
  routines (using Jenkins scripted pipelines and Python / Bash scripts).
- Provided backup and disaster recovery strategies for infrastructure (with AWS
  capabilities: EBS snapshots, RDS multi A-Z, S3 cross-region replication &c).
- Containerized custom application for big data processing using Docker.

| **self-employed** | **May 2016 - Jun 2018 (2 years, 2 months)** |
| :- | -: |
| Independent | St Petersburg City, Russia |

- Studied key principles of programming (Algorithms and data structures),
