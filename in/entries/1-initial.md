# Initial. Understanding the Rust type system

Because Rust relies heavily on the type system, it requires an
understanding of the type theory. Which, in turn, requires an
understanding of the set theory. And set theory relies on such
mathematical foundations like integral calculus and trigonometric theory
series.

So i'm going to add some notes on these topics as i fall into the abyss.
