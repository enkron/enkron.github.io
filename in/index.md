# [Hello](/download/cover.pdf)

Devops engineer with a bachelor's degree in CS and {{total_work_period}} of
experience in some technologies and programming languages. I mainly act in a
devops field: from automation of routine processes using scripting languages
like Python and Bash to develop and maintain reliable systems for big data
processing in cloud platforms (in particular AWS). I also have a great interest
in systems programming: especially the development in Rust.

Always try to keep my level of awareness of technologies up to date, hence I
periodically read books about old but super important stuff (Linux API, data
structures, algorithms &c) and new projects as well (Rust, WASM, Kubernetes
&c). Also aspire to contribute to open source software one day.

From the software development perspective I try to grab hands on experience by
develop pet projects (please check my [github](https://github.com/enkron)
account for examples). Currently I'm digging into the type system, data
structures and references' lifetimes. And plan to integrate concurrent/async
programming into my daily activities.

In my last work experience I prototyped and implemented CI system using
Jenkins, Docker Swarm, and HAProxy. Deployed monitoring solution with
Prometheus, Grafana and Grafana Mimir. Configured alerting with Prometheus
AlertManager and Slack. Implemented SSO authentication using SAML2.0 and GSuite
as identity provider.

Prototyped and implemented CI infrastructure POC using terraform as IaC
solution. The infrastructure consisted of Kubernetes cluster deployed on AWS
Fargate with Jenkins application as a CI system, AWS PCA for TLS encryption and
dockerhub as a container registry.

Deployed self-hosted runners for bitbucket pipelines

Created and refactored bunch of groovy pipelines for developer and tester
teams.

And of course my daily duties included monitoring the state of the servers,
administering and configuring Linux hosts (authentication, logging, cleanup,
provisioning new VMs and containers, networking problems etc), administering
Atlassian stack (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket).

Many thanks, \
Sergei
