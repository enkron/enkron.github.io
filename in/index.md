# [Hello](/download/cover.pdf)

Devops engineer with a bachelor's degree in CS and near the five years of<br>
experience in some technologies and programming languages.<br>
I mainly act in a devops field: from automation of routine processes using<br>
scripting languages like Python and Bash to develop and maintain reliable<br>
systems for big data processing in cloud platforms (in particular AWS).<br>
I also have a great interest in systems programming: especially the development<br>
in Rust.<br>

Always try to keep my level of awareness of technologies up to date, hence I<br>
periodically read books about old but super important stuff (Linux API, data<br>
structures, algorithms etc) and new projects as well (Docker, Rust etc). Also<br>
aspire to contribute to open source software one day.<br>

From the software development perspective I try to grab hands on experience by<br>
develop pet projects (please check my [github](https://github.com/enkron)<br>
account for examples).  Currently I'm digging into the type system, data<br>
structures and references' lifetimes. And plan to integrate concurrent/async<br>
programming into my daily activities.<br>

In my last work experience I dealt with bare-metal servers rather than the now<br>
familiar cloud solutions. To automate routine processes I was creating Ansible<br>
playbooks for upgrade and deployment Confluence instances to the stage and<br>
production environments. Also was deploying and troubleshooting Bitbucket's<br>
mirror farm.<br>
Our team has created CI/CD pipelines using Buildbot (not very popular<br>
solution). I've also developed CLI utility using Python for automatic migration<br>
from one CRM system to another (Salesforce to JIRA) in a fairly short period of<br>
time. And of course my daily duties included monitoring the state of the<br>
servers, administering and configuring Linux hosts (authentication, logging,<br>
cleanup, provisioning new VMs and containers, networking problems etc),<br>
administering Atlassian stack (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket).<br>

Many thanks,<br>
Sergei<br>
