<h1><a href="/download/cover.pdf" title="export to pdf">Hello</a></h1>

Devops engineer with a bachelor\'s degree in CS and near the six years of
experience in some technologies and programming languages.
I mainly act in a devops field: from automation of routine processes using
scripting languages like Python and Bash to develop and maintain reliable
systems for big data processing in cloud platforms (in particular AWS).
I also have a great interest in systems programming: especially the development
in Rust.

Always try to keep my level of awareness of technologies up to date,
hence i periodically read books about old but super important stuff
(Linux API, data structures, algorithms &c) and new projects as well
(Rust, WASM, Kubernetes &c). Also aspire to contribute to open source
software one day.

From the software development perspective i try to grab hands on experience by
develop pet projects (please check my [github](https://github.com/enkron)
account for examples). Currently i\'m digging into the type system, data
structures and references\' lifetimes. And plan to integrate concurrent/async
programming into my daily activities.

In my last work experience i dealt with bare-metal servers rather than
the now familiar cloud solutions. To automate routine processes i was
creating Ansible playbooks for upgrade and deployment Confluence
instances to the stage and production environments. Also was deploying
and troubleshooting Bitbucket\'s mirror farm. Our team has created CI/CD
pipelines using Buildbot (not very popular solution). Developed CLI
utility using Python for automatic migration from one CRM system to
another (Salesforce to JIRA) in a fairly short period of time.

Also i was developing CI/CD pipelines for customers\' applications which
exploited big data platform using Jenkins, Ansible, Python, Gitlab and
Bash. Modeled, developed and maintained AWS CloudFormation templates
for managing and provisioning infrastructure as a code. Refactored and
evolved existing Ansible playbooks for full infrastructure
configuration. Configured Kerberos security protocol for authentication
of services within Hadoop cluster. Provided backup and disaster
recovery strategies for infrastructure (with AWS capabilities: EBS
snapshots, RDS multi A-Z, S3 cross-region replication etc).

And of course my daily duties included monitoring the state of the
servers, administering and configuring Linux hosts (authentication, logging,
cleanup, provisioning new VMs and containers, networking problems etc),
administering Atlassian stack (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket).

Many thanks,<br>
